1.1.1 (L1) Ensure 'Enforce password history' is set to '24 or more password(s)' (Automated),"This policy setting determines the number of renewed, unique passwords that have to be associated with a user account before you can reuse an old password. The value for this policy setting must be between 0 and 24 passwords. The default value for stand alone systems is 0 passwords, but the default setting when joined to a domain is 24 passwords. To maintain the effectiveness of this policy setting, use the Minimum password age setting to prevent users from repeatedly changing their password. The recommended state for this setting is: 24 or more password(s).",0,Fail,"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 24 or more password(s): Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Enforce password history"
"1.1.2 (L1) Ensure 'Maximum password age' is set to '365 or fewer days, but not 0' (Automated)","This policy setting defines how long a user can use their password before it expires. Values for this policy setting range from 0 to 999 days. If you set the value to 0, the password will never expire. Because attackers can crack passwords, the more frequently you change the password the less opportunity an attacker has to use a cracked password. However, the lower this value is set, the higher the potential for an increase in calls to help desk support due to users having to change their password or forgetting which password is current. The recommended state for this setting is 365 or fewer days, but not 0.",42,Pass,
1.1.3 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password age' is set to '1 or more day(s)' (Automated),This policy setting determines the number of days that you must use a password before you can change it. The range of values for this policy setting is between 1 and 999 days. (You may also set the value to 0 to allow immediate password changes.) The default value for this setting is 0 days. The recommended state for this setting is: 1 or more day(s).,0,Fail,"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 1 or more day(s): Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password age"
1.1.4 (L1) Ensure 'Minimum password length' is set to '14 or more character(s)' (Automated),"This policy setting determines the least number of characters that make up a password for a user account. There are many different theories about how to determine the best password length for an organization, but perhaps 'passphrase' is a better term than 'password.' The recommended state for this setting is: 14 or more character(s).",0,Fail,"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to 14 or more character(s): Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Minimum password length"
1.1.5 (L1) Ensure 'Password must meet complexity requirements' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated),"This policy setting checks all new passwords to ensure that they meet basic requirements for strong passwords. When enabled, passwords must not contain the user's name, be at least 6 characters long, and contain characters from three of the following: uppercase, lowercase, digits, special characters, or Unicode. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.",0,Fail,"To establish the recommended configuration via GP, set the following UI path to Enabled: Computer Configuration\Policies\Windows Settings\Security Settings\Account Policies\Password Policy\Password must meet complexity requirements"
1.1.6 (L1) Ensure 'Relax minimum password length limits' is set to 'Enabled' (Automated),This policy setting allows the Minimum password length to exceed 14 characters for local accounts. This setting only applies to newer Windows 10 or Server 2022 systems. The recommended state for this setting is: Enabled.,"Key Found, Value Not Present",Error,
1.1.7 (L1) Ensure 'Store passwords using reversible encryption' is set to 'Disabled' (Automated),"This policy setting determines whether passwords are stored using reversible encryption, which is essentially storing them as plaintext. The recommended state for this setting is: Disabled.",0,Pass,
